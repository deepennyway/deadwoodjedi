The key to this team is utilizing Renegades cooldown reduction skill to reset the abilities of your Unkillable champion. You still must bring in a champion to tank the stun - typically Skullcrusher.  Another important note is you must NOT book the cooldown of Renegades A3 skill, so it remains on a 6 turn cooldown.  You can use Kymar instead of Renegade, but the speed requirements become slightly highert for Skullcrusher, Renegade and significantly higher for your Unkillable Champ.  Lastly you can use a FULLY BOOKED Sir Nicholas in this comp!

Also, because there's no speed buffs, extra turn champions such as Rotos can be used without fear of breaking the speed tune - they may however throw off the stun targeting.
 
 265-285 - Unkillable Champ (Warcaster, Sir Nicholas, Roschard the Tower - goes last)
 248-254 - Seeker (goes second)
 245-247 - Renegade (must be faster than Stun champ and slower than Seeker - goes third)
 245-247 - Stun Target (Typically Skullcrusher, though in theory any 3 turn cooldown Unkillable champ can work - goes second to last)
 218-227 - DPS / Support (goes first)

*Stun Targeting is essential, so a negative or neutral affinity champ is ideal for that purpose.
*Avoid negative affinity DPS champions.
*Does not work well for Spirit affinity without a cleanser in the DPS slot or Block Debuffs - which will likely tank damage output.

 Stun targeting is always an issue, so avoid Lifedrinker mastery on your stun target. Champions like Bad-el-Kazar can provide too much healing and should be carefully considered before using. 
 Using Rust's Stun Calculator can certainly help in setting it up, however it's only an approximation, not exact.

 It is recommended you manual the first 2-3 cycles of the fight to ensure you stay in sync.
 
 HP of Stun Target should be the highest of the team, but not more than 125% of PK's HP.
 PK should be second highest HP.
 (ex. If PK has 40K HP, then your Stun Target needs to be between 41K-50K).
 A good target to aim for is 10% more than PK. (so 44K in the above example)
 Stun Target's DEF should be as low as possible, at least several hundred lower than anyone else on the team.
 When facing affinities, the Stun Target ideally should be the weak affinity (vs Magic have a spirit one), or otherwise there should be no weak affinity champions on the team. 
 *Avoid having a strong affinity Stun Target! It's just not worth it.
 
 Example HP/DEF Tuning:
 Aim for 1k DEF and 35k-40k HP on the Stun Target, at least 2k DEF and 30-35k HP on the rest. Pain Keeper should have 2nd highest HP on team.
 Affinities will screw up your run - use a weak affinity for the Stun Target!
 Watch your runs! Hard to know how to fix it if you don't know where it went wrong...

 Note: This differs slightly from u/abscity's original guide. Here, both DPS are in the 175-178 range; this gets into fully unkillable faster, and avoids having TM ties between Tower and Doompriest that can wreak havoc.
 
 The 186 will always go first after AOE2 to cleanse debuffs and before Skullcrusher to cleanse the Stun. Doompriest can cleanse both and as such is an ideal fit to make this affinity friendly.
 
 If you're using Grizzled Jarl instead of Doompriest, then you want to replace the 186 Doompriest with a 186 DPS and one of the other DPS champs with a 173 Grizzled Jarl.

  It is recommended you manual first 2-3 cycles of the CB to ensure you stay in sync.
 
 HP of Stun Target should be the highest of the team, but not more than 125% of PK's HP.
 PK should be second highest HP.
 (ex. If PK has 40K HP, then your Stun Target needs to be between 41K-50K).
 A good target to aim for is 10% more than PK. (so 44K in the above example)
 Stun Target's DEF should be as low as possible, at least several hundred lower than anyone else on the team.
 When facing affinities, the Stun Target ideally should be the weak affinity (vs Magic have a spirit one), or otherwise there should be no weak affinity champions on the team. 
 *Avoid having a strong affinity Stun Target! It's just not worth it.
 
 Example HP/DEF Tuning:
 Aim for 1k DEF and 35k-40k HP on the Stun Target, at least 2k DEF and 30-35k HP on the rest. Pain Keeper should have 2nd highest HP on team.
 Affinities will screw up your run - use a weak affinity for the Stun Target!
 Watch your runs! Hard to know how to fix it if you don't know where it went wrong...

 These narrower speed ranges allow for a single setup to be used across multiple difficulties.
Speed ranges for each difficulty are wider than shown above. 
There is a lot of interdependency, and multiple tunes across the different difficulties that will eventually settle into the 2:1 and 5:2 turn ratios.
This tune may require a bit more effort to get the speeds precise enough for, but greatly simplifies the setup across difficulties.
CHECK YOUR SPEEDS WITH THE CALCULATOR!

 Maneaters are going at a 5:2 turn ratio, alternating triple turns, while the rest of the team is going at a 2:1 turn ratio.
The Maneaters keep the team affinity-friendly and unkillable.
