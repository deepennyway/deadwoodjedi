Below is a list of accumulated Speed Compositions. These have been gathered and created by myself and others in the community.

Some are easy to implement, others prove very intricate. Make sure to read all associated material to avoid any mistakes and, as always, test your specific composition in the calculator and double check your masteries before using keys! 99% of all issues come down to having the wrong masteries or not correctly inputting information in the calculator. Save yourself some silver and double check!

Below you'll find different compositions organized by speed and type. When you find one that interests you click on VIEW COMPOSITION button and it will take you to a page that gives a more complete breakdown of that Speed Tune.
