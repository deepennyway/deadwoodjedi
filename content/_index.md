â€‹If this is your first time visiting the site, above on the header are links to all the different resources offered here.  I HIGHLY recommend visiting the [HELP](/help/) section first. It will include basic instructions and advanced guidance to help you speed tune your team. There is also a [Video Tutorial](/help#video-tutorial) there if you prefer to learn about the Calculator through a visual medium.

Also, the calculator can have issues with AdBlockers turned on - disabling it should fix the issue.

If you are looking for a specific speed tune, then you will want to check out the [Speed Tune List](/speed-tune-list/). It contains a list of known tunes and advice on using them when applicable. Do take care, many of these speed tunes are advanced and require some setup to implement. Also, they may be more susceptible to speed changes than most, so fine tuning may be required for your particular composition!

The [Advice and Guides](/resources/) section contains columns and guidance from some of the smartest raiders I've come across. If you want to understand how speed works, or need a guide to build your team, or even just a group of fellow nerds to hang out with we have you covered!

At the bottom of every page you will see links to all my socials including my DeadwoodJedi Discord Group where you can get help and advice as well as discuss your current team or theory craft with others. There are also links to my YouTube, Twitch, and Twitter accounts.  You can also join my Patreon if you are looking for a Clan Boss Tune-Up, Coaching session, or access to the Epic Version of the Clan Boss Calculator.
