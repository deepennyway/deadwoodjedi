      <description>Below is a list of accumulated Speed Compositions. These have been gathered and created by myself and others in the community.
Some are easy to implement, others prove very intricate. Make sure to read all associated material to avoid any mistakes and, as always, test your specific composition in the calculator and double check your masteries before using keys! 99% of all issues come down to having the wrong masteries or not correctly inputting information in the calculator.</description>

      <description>This is a compendium of various articles about Raid: Shadow Legends contributed by the community. These are some of the brightest and nerdiest minds in Raid and we should all be thankful for it! Myself, I can only follow a fraction of the topics presented, but even I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s some genius level thinking going on here. So if you want to actually be smarter in the game (or feel dumb outside of it) peruse what lies within!</description>

      <description>What the heck is this &amp;ldquo;Calculator&amp;rdquo;?!?
The Clan Boss Speed Calculator is a tool to help you calculate when your champions are taking their turns in relation to the Clan Boss, what skills they will use, and in general finding the best way to maximize the damage your compositions can do. Like any tool, however, the Calculator is only as useful as the artisan who wields it. And this tool can be very simple or very complicated, depending on what you want to accomplish, but in either case this calculator follows some very specific rules that you will need to know and accomidate in order to effectively use the calculator.</description>

      <title>Speed Tunes List</title>

      <description>Thanks for viewing the list of Speed Tunes!
The Compositions are organized into two distinct categories: General Speed Tunes and Champion Specific. The General Speed Tunes lists the different compositions according to the speed tune ratios achieved and/or if they are unkillable teams. Champion Specific organizes tunes by the specific champions required. I also would recommend looking at the DeadwoodJedi Recommended Tunes, which is a list of Speed Tunes I like most.</description>
