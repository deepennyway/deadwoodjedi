title: Guides & Resources

This is a compendium of various articles about Raid: Shadow Legends contributed by the community.  These are some of the brightest and nerdiest minds in Raid and we should all be thankful for it!  Myself, I can only follow a fraction of the topics presented, but even I can tell there's some genius level thinking going on here.  So if you want to actually be smarter in the game (or feel dumb outside of it) peruse what lies within! 

If you count yourself among the geekiest of us (it's a surprisingly large club!) and want to contribute an article contact me through email or discord.
