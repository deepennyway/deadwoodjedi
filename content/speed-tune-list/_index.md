Thanks for viewing the list of Speed Tunes!

The Compositions are organized into two distinct categories:  General Speed Tunes and Champion Specific.  The General Speed Tunes lists the different compositions according to the speed tune ratios achieved and/or if they are unkillable teams. Champion Specific organizes tunes by the specific champions required. I also would recommend looking at the DeadwoodJedi Recommended Tunes, which is a list of Speed Tunes I like most.

Simply select the corresponding tune type and it will take you to a list of all such tunes I've been able to record. The list will give a brief summary of the tune as well as any associated information and video. Many of the simple tunes need little to no additional information, the more advanced ones can have whole guides linked within. It may take a few seconds to load.
